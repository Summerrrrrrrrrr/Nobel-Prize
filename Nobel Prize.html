                <h2>Origin and History</h2>
                                <p>Alfred Nobel, the father of the Nobel Prize, founded a series of medals in 5 different categories: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. He declared the establishment of the Nobel Prize through his last will, in the hope of awarding the talents who confer “greatest benefit on mankind”.</p>

                <h2>Meet the awardees of the year!</h2>
    
                    <h3>David Baker: Construction of New Protein Kinds</h3>
                <img src="https://attach.setn.com/newsimages/2024/10/11/4845570-PH.jpg">
                        <h4>Why is it significant?</h4>
                                <p>The proteins in nature <b>evolved</b> under the constraints of natural selection. They have to finish their research <b>within a short period of time</b>, otherwise the proteins will make changes and all their efforts will be wasted.</p>
                                <p><b>No one</b> has <b>successfully</b> found ways to control biomolecules before because knowledge regarding protein-folding principles are insufficient, all works by him are <b>groundbreaking</b>.</p>
                                <p>Protein-design and protein-structure prediction are based upon the protein-folding principles. David Baker and his team have to <b>understand these principles in broad outlines</b>.</p>
                        <h4>How does it benefit the world?</h4>
                                <p>The ability to predict and model protein structures helps deal with previously incurable yet common diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, and the Ebola virus.
                                <p>The COVID-19 vaccine is the first computationally designed protein medicine, showcasing the practical applications of Baker's research.</p>

                                <h4>How does Baker inspire the science industry?</h4>
                                <p>David Baker's construction offers a glimmer of hope to the medical field, as some fatal diseases can now be cured thanks to his groundbreaking research.</p>
                    <h3>Demis Hassabis and John Jumper: AI model development</h3>
                <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSspgW-YZQT_QDxVo2lD1obS8LVqSBh6o1dUg&s">
                (on the left-Demis Hassabis; on the right-John Jumper)
                        <h4>Why is it significant?</h4>
                                <p>Before AlphaFold, predicting the structure of a protein was <b>a complex and time-consuming process</b>.</p>
                                <p>The structure of <b>all the 200 million proteins</b> identified by researchers previously <b>can be predicted in the AI system created by them</b>.</p>
                                <p><b>Solved an ongoing issue of half a century</b>, to predict proteins’ complex structures with the aid of AI</p>
                        <h4>How does it benefit the world?</h4>
                                <p>It helps scientists to build data, simulates experiments, modeling complexity, etc. AlphaFold can be a powerful tool for scientists to make foundational scientific breakthroughs in <b>a less time-consuming way and more new discoveries can be made</b>.</p>
                        <h4>How do they inspire the science industry?</h4>
                                <p>Good example of utilizing and embracing artificial intelligence, solve science problems technologically.</p>
                                <p>A key demonstration that AI will make science faster and ultimately help to understand <b>disease and develop therapeutics</b>.</p>

                <h2>Role and Value of Nobel Prize in Today's World</h2>
                                <p>Nobel prize is one of the motivations for scientists that keeps their fire of making life-changing contributions and discoveries burning. The Prize is not only a prize, but scientists' <b>encouragement, recognition and confidence</b>.</p>
                                <p>Governments might be encouraged to send out more subsidies supporting scientific projects. Since Nobel Prize reflects a nation's ability in scientific and technology field,to wining Nobel Prize could gain a high international recognition, bringing glory to their country.
                                <p>The present will be the future's past. As a hall of fame, <b>scientists' legacy lives on</b> and will forever be contributed and recorded.
